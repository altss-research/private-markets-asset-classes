# Natural Resources

Natural Resources refer to investments in assets derived from the extraction, production, or ownership of commodities and raw materials that underpin global economic activity. These assets are typically finite in nature and closely tied to supply–demand dynamics and commodity markets.

## Characteristics

- Exposure to physical resources such as energy, metals, minerals, and agricultural inputs  
- Returns driven by commodity prices, production volumes, and operating efficiency  
- Sensitivity to global macroeconomic trends and geopolitical conditions  
- Potential inflation protection due to linkage with real-economy input costs  
- Higher volatility relative to core real asset strategies  

## Common Structures

- Closed-end natural resource and energy funds  
- Asset-level ownership through operating companies  
- Royalty and streaming arrangements  
- Joint ventures and project-level special purpose vehicles (SPVs)  

## Common Allocator Use Cases

- Inflation hedging  
- Diversification across real-economy exposures  
- Tactical or cyclical return enhancement  
- Exposure to long-term resource scarcity themes
