# Secondaries

Secondaries refer to transactions involving the purchase and sale of existing interests in private market funds or underlying assets, rather than primary commitments to new funds. The secondary market provides liquidity to existing investors and portfolio management flexibility to allocators.

## Characteristics

- Transactions occur after a fund has commenced operations
- Assets typically have existing performance history and portfolio visibility
- Pricing reflects net asset value (NAV), liquidity conditions, and market demand
- Reduced blind-pool risk relative to primary investments
- Returns driven by discount capture, portfolio maturation, and active management

## Common Structures

- **LP-led secondaries** (transfer of limited partner fund interests)
- **GP-led secondaries** (continuation vehicles, fund restructurings)
- **Direct secondaries** (single-asset or portfolio-level transactions)
- **Synthetic secondaries** and structured liquidity solutions
- **Tender offers** for partial liquidity events

## Common Allocator Use Cases

- Liquidity management and portfolio rebalancing
- Reducing exposure to older vintages or non-core managers
- Accelerating capital deployment into mature portfolios
- Managing pacing, denominator effects, or regulatory constraints
- Gaining targeted exposure to specific assets or sectors

## Risk Considerations

- Valuation risk tied to sponsor marks and market conditions
- Concentration risk in single-asset or continuation structures
- Alignment and governance complexity in GP-led transactions
- Sensitivity to fundraising cycles and secondary market liquidity

Secondaries are increasingly viewed by allocators as a core portfolio management tool rather than a niche strategy, particularly in periods of market dislocation or constrained exit activity.
