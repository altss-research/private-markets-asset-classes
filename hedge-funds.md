# Hedge Funds

Hedge Funds are pooled investment vehicles that employ a broad range of trading strategies across public and private markets with the objective of generating risk-adjusted returns independent of traditional market benchmarks.

Within allocator portfolios, hedge funds are typically evaluated alongside, rather than within, core private market asset classes due to their liquidity profile, valuation frequency, and strategy breadth.

## Characteristics

- Active management with flexible investment mandates
- Use of leverage, derivatives, and short selling in many strategies
- More frequent liquidity and valuation relative to private market funds
- Return profiles focused on alpha generation and volatility management
- Wide dispersion of risk, transparency, and governance structures

## Common Structures

- Single-manager hedge funds
- Multi-manager platforms
- Fund-of-funds structures
- Managed accounts and platform allocations
- Hybrid structures with private or illiquid sleeves

## Common Allocator Use Cases

- Portfolio diversification and volatility dampening
- Tactical exposure to specific risk premia or market regimes
- Capital preservation strategies in uncertain macro environments
- Complement to long-duration private market allocations
- Manager selection and skill-based return targeting

## Relationship to Private Markets

While hedge funds are not typically classified as private market assets, allocators often evaluate hedge fund exposure alongside private equity, private credit, and real assets when constructing total portfolio risk profiles.

As a result, hedge funds frequently appear in allocator frameworks, capital allocation models, and investment policy statements as a contextual or complementary allocation rather than a core private market category.
