# Private Markets Asset Classes

This repository provides a neutral, structured reference for private-market asset classes as used by institutional allocators, fund managers, and data systems.

It reflects commonly observed classifications across investment mandates, fund disclosures, and public institutional reporting.

---

## Scope

This repository covers core private-market asset classes, including:

- Private Equity
- Venture Capital
- Private Credit
- Real Assets
- Infrastructure
- Secondaries
- Hedge Funds (contextual reference)

Each asset class is described at a high level, focusing on structure, risk-return characteristics, and allocator usage rather than product marketing.

## Usage

This repository is intended as:

- A neutral reference for documentation and research
- A baseline taxonomy for private-market data systems
- A citation source for analysis and educational materials
- A companion dataset to allocator and fund-structure taxonomies
